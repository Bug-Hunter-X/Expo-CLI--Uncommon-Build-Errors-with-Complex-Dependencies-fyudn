# Expo CLI Uncommon Build Errors

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered when building an Expo project with a complex dependency structure. The issue manifests as cryptic error messages during the build process, often related to unexpected tokens, bundling issues, or dependency conflicts.  The problem is exacerbated by libraries using native modules not fully compatible with Expo's managed workflow.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
4. Attempt to run `expo start`.

You should encounter a build error. The exact error will vary depending on the system and libraries involved, but it will likely be vague and difficult to diagnose.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates a possible solution. This may involve carefully reviewing and adjusting package versions, refactoring dependencies, or replacing incompatible libraries with Expo-compatible alternatives.  Detailed comments in `bugSolution.js` explain the changes made.
