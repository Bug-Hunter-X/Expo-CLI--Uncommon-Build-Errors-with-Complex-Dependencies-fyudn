// bugSolution.js
// This file demonstrates a possible solution to the uncommon Expo CLI build errors.
// The specific solution will vary greatly based on the nature of the error and the problematic dependencies.

// Example: Resolving Version Conflicts
// Ensure compatibility between different packages by carefully selecting their versions.
// Example: npm install react@18 react-native-web@0.18.10

// Example: Refactoring Dependencies
// If a library causes issues, try replacing it with an alternative that is better suited for the Expo environment.
// Import the alternative library instead of the problematic one.

// Example:  Using Expo-compatible Libraries
// Expo has a curated list of libraries that are known to work well. Try using those for better compatibility.

// Example:   Troubleshooting Native Modules
// If a library depends on native modules, you might need to use the bare workflow or explore alternatives to bypass that dependency.

// This example is illustrative and might need adjustments depending on the specific libraries and error encountered.
