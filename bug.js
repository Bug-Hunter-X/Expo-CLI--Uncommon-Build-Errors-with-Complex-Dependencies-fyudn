This bug occurs when using Expo CLI with a project that has a complex dependency tree or uses certain uncommon libraries.  The error message might not be very descriptive, and you may see issues like `Unexpected token` during build,  or various errors related to bundling or linking dependencies.  This often happens when there are conflicts between package versions or when a library is not correctly configured for the Expo environment. For instance, if a library uses native modules that aren't compatible with Expo's managed workflow, you'll encounter problems.
